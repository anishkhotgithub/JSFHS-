Create Maven Project:

	When we create any java application like web apps, desktop app,
	android application. You'll require jar files.

	eg. Connecting database we require jar file.
	    For sending email we require email jar file.

	So, handling multiple jar files, downloading and
	managing jar versions is very difficult.

	So, for managing dependencies we can create maven project.
	Maven Project gives on xml file where we can put our jar file
	names and it will download all jar files for us in 
	central repository (in one local folder instead of our project).	


	Steps for creating maven project:

	
	
	1) Click on file -> new -> maven project -> next	
	2) In Archetypes search for quickstart and select apache maven quickstart -> next
	3) Give group id (base package name) and achetype id (project name) -> finish.
	
			base package name -> com.niit
			project name	  -> hibernate

	
	
	4) goto pom.xml file and put hibernate core & mysql dependency.
	   copy dependency from mvnrepository website.
	   copy mysql dependency from mvnrepository.
		
	
	5) Create model (User.java)
	6) Right click on project -> properties -> java build path 
	7) Under source -> click add folder -> click on main -> click on new folder
			-> give folder name as resources -> finish.

	8) Create hibernate.cfg.xml file in resources folder
	9) Create DbConfig File.

	11) UserDAO interface for user methods.
	12) UserDAOIMPL implementation of methods.
	13) User Test java file.

Hibernate

	1) Database Independent
	2) ReadyMade Database Code


	Hibernate:
		1) HQL Query (Hibernate Query Language)
		2) In-Built Methods
		3) SQL Query

	ORM - Object Relational Mapping

	Object 		- Class
	Relational	- Database tables
	Mapping
	
	
	We are going to map our class with table.

	Employees(table)
		employeeid
		employeename

	Employee (class)
		employeeid
		employeename


	

	1) Goto services tab
	2) Expand databases node
	3) Right click on java db -> start server.
	4) Right click on java db -> create database.
	5) Put databasename, username and password.
	6) Expand your database connection.
	7) Right click on tables folder -> execute command.
	8) Write sql query to create table.
	

		create table employees
		(
		    employeeid int primary key,
		    employeename varchar(40)
		)
